# Minimal-Minesweeper-game
This game is played on a table of size n√ón. When the game is started, some hidden mines are deployed on the board randomly. The player can uncover a single cell by telling x and y coordinates. If there is a mine on this cell, the game is over. Otherwise, the game continues until a mine is found.
